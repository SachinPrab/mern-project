#### **Project Title**  
**MERN Stack CRUD Application** – A dynamic web app with Zustand state management and Chakra UI.  

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-live-brightgreen)](https://mern-project-zl0e.onrender.com)

#### **🔹 Key Features**  
✅ **Full CRUD Operations** – Create, read, update, and delete data via a React frontend and Node.js API.  
✅ **Modern State Management** – Used **Zustand** to handle global state (e.g., form data, UI toggles).  
✅ **Responsive UI** – Built with **Chakra UI** for clean, reusable components (modals, forms, alerts).  

⚠️ **Authentication (Planned)** – *Future goal: Add JWT auth for user sessions.*  

#### **🔹 Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend**: React, Zustand, Chakra UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
- **Tools**: Postman (API testing), Git, VSCode

- **Documentation**: Update the README if adding new features.

## 🧠 Backend Knowledge Summary (MERN Stack)

I’ve built a full-fledged backend using the **MERN stack**, with a strong understanding of **RESTful API development** using **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. I structured the codebase following the **MVC architecture**, organizing logic into separate folders for **controllers**, **models**, and **routes** to maintain modularity and clean separation of concerns. The **MongoDB connection** logic is isolated in a `db.js` file inside the `config` folder, using **Mongoose** to define schemas and interact with the database.

I’ve implemented all asynchronous operations using `async/await` within `try/catch` blocks for proper **error handling** and reliability. Sensitive configuration details like database URIs are stored in environment variables using **dotenv** to keep them secure. I also successfully **deployed** the backend to **Render** after pushing the code to **GitHub**, and connected it to a live **MongoDB Atlas** instance.

I can confidently explain how each part of the backend interacts and contributes to the overall functionality of the application.
